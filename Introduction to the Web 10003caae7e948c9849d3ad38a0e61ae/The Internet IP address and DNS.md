# The Internet: IP address and DNS

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that communicate with each other using standardized protocols. Two key components of the Internet are IP addresses and DNS. 

An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to the Internet. It consists of a series of numbers separated by periods, such as 192.168.0.1. 

IP addresses are used to identify and route data packets across the Internet, enabling devices to communicate with each other. 

There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4, which uses 32-bit addresses, and IPv6, which uses 128-bit addresses. DNS, or Domain Name System, is a hierarchical naming system that maps domain names to IP addresses.

 It allows users to access websites and other Internet resources using user-friendly domain names, such as **[www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)**, instead of having to remember the corresponding IP address. When a user types a domain name into a web browser, the browser uses DNS to look up the IP address associated with that domain name, and then uses the IP address to connect to the corresponding web server.

 Overall, IP addresses and DNS play important roles in enabling the Internet to function as a global network, allowing devices to communicate with each other and users to access online resources using human-friendly names.
