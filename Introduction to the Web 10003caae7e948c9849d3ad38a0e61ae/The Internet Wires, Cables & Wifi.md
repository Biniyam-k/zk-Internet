# The Internet: Wires, Cables & Wifi

The Internet is a global network of computers and devices that are connected together to allow for the exchange of information and communication. The physical infrastructure that allows this network to function includes wires, cables, and WiFi.

**Binary encoding** is the process of representing data or information using only two digits, typically 0 and 1. This is the fundamental encoding system used in computing, where digital signals and data are processed and stored using electronic devices that can recognize and manipulate binary values.

In binary encoding, each bit (binary digit) can have only two possible values, 0 or 1, and each digit represents a power of 2. For example, the binary number 1010 represents the decimal number 10, because the first digit from the right represents 0x2^0=0, the second digit represents 1x2^1=2, the third digit represents 0x2^2=0, and the fourth digit represents 1x2^3=8.

Binary encoding is used for a wide range of tasks in computing, including representing numbers, text, images, and other forms of data. It is the basis for all digital communications and computing systems, and is a key part of the modern world's technological infrastructure.

To send a single bit of information in binary from one place to another, you can use a simple on-off signal or a physical switch that can be in one of two states, representing the 0 or 1 bit value.

For example, you could use a physical switch that is in the "on" position to represent a 1 bit, and in the "off" position to represent a 0 bit. This is the basic idea behind Morse code, which is a communication system that uses short and long on-off signals (dots and dashes) to represent letters and numbers.

In digital communication systems, a single bit can be represented as an electrical signal that is either high or low, on or off, representing 1 or 0, respectively. This signal can be transmitted through wires, fiber optic cables, or wireless communication channels to another location, where it can be received and decoded into the original bit value.

In summary, to send a single bit of information in binary from one place to another, you need a way to encode the bit value as a physical signal or switch position, transmit the signal or switch position to the destination, and then decode the signal or switch position back into the original bit value at the receiving end.

**Bitrate** refers to the amount of data that is processed or transmitted per unit of time, usually measured in bits per second (bps). In the context of digital audio and video, bitrate is the amount of data used to represent one second of audio or video content.

For example, if a video has a bitrate of 5 Mbps, it means that 5 million bits of data are transmitted or processed per second to display the video. Similarly, if an audio file has a bitrate of 128 kbps, it means that 128,000 bits of data are used to represent one second of audio.

The higher the bitrate, the more data is used to represent the content, resulting in higher quality and more detailed output. However, higher bitrates also require more storage space and more bandwidth to transmit.

**Bandwidth** refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network or communication channel in a given amount of time. It is usually measured in bits per second (bps) or some multiple of bps, such as kilobits per second (Kbps) or megabits per second (Mbps).

In simple terms, bandwidth represents the capacity of a network or communication channel to transfer data from one point to another. A high bandwidth network can transfer more data in a given amount of time than a low bandwidth network.

Bandwidth is affected by various factors, such as the type of connection (e.g. wired or wireless), the quality of the connection, and the number of users sharing the network. It is an important consideration when designing and managing networks, as it can affect the speed, reliability, and quality of data transmission.

**Latency** is the amount of time it takes for a data packet to travel from one point to another across a network or communication channel. It is typically measured in milliseconds (ms) and represents the delay between sending a request or data packet and receiving a response.

Latency can be affected by various factors, such as the physical distance between the sender and receiver, the quality of the network connection, the number of intermediate devices or nodes in the network, and the amount of traffic on the network.

Low latency is important for many real-time applications, such as online gaming, video conferencing, and live streaming, where even a small delay can have a noticeable impact on the user experience. High latency can cause delays and other performance issues, making it difficult to maintain real-time interactions and smooth data transmission.

Data can be transmitted through cables by encoding it as a sequence of 0's and 1's, which are also known as bits. This is done using a technique called digital modulation, which transforms analog signals (such as electrical signals traveling through a wire) into a sequence of binary digits.

Wires and cables are used to physically connect devices to each other and to the Internet. These connections can be made using copper or fiber optic cables, which transmit data as electrical or light signals. The cables are laid out on the ground, buried underground, or run overhead on utility poles.

WiFi, on the other hand, uses wireless technology to connect devices to the Internet. It relies on radio waves to transmit data between devices and the Internet. WiFi signals are broadcast by a router, which acts as a wireless access point. Devices within the router's range can connect to the Internet wirelessly.

Overall, the Internet infrastructure includes a combination of wired and wireless technologies, all working together to ensure reliable and efficient communication across the globe.
