****What is the Internet?**** 

Many, many years ago in the early 1970s Vincent and Bob Kahn  began working on the design of what we now call the internet. t was a result of another experiment called the ARPANET
which stood for Advanced Research Project Agency Network. 

It was a Defense Department research project. Paul Baran was trying to figure out how to build a
communication system that might actually survive a nuclear attack. So he had this idea of breaking messages up into blocks and sending them as fast as possible in every possible direction through the mesh network.
